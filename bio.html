	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a senior studying Congitive and Brain Science at Tufts University. My aspirations are to conduct research in the field of cognitive science focusing mainly on developmental psychopathology and the way that mental health issues in children and adolescents can be mitigated using cognitive behavioral techniques. I spent my junior year abroad studying Psychology at University College London. In my free time I enjoy singing and playing guitar.</p>
