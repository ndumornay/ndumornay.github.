<!--- this is how you do a comment in HTML (shift+cmd+C) -->

# Let's get started

Here is some text I've added.

Now have some code as well:

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)


#Let's read in some data
mn = read_csv(file = "mn-schools.csv")
mn
```
```{r plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="**Figure 1.** *A scatterplot of graduation rates vs SAT scores.*"}
#scatter plot of graduation rates vs SAT scores
ggplot(data = mn, aes(x = grad, y = sat)) + 
  theme_light() +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Graduation Rate", y = "Average SAT Score")
```
Google "knitr" to see more fig. options!

The mean graduation rate is `r round(mean(mn$grad), 2)`.


## Here is a subsection

Have some more words.

## Holy Help Tab
If you wanna figure out how to do more things, check out the Markdown Quick Reference.

There's also a Keyboard Shortcuts Reference in there.

For more YAML customizations see this [link](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html).

## Wanna write some equations?

$$
Y{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \epsilon_i
$$

If you'd like to make it inline, use one '\$' instead of two: $\hat{\beta}_0$.

Btw, see 'bookdown' package for advanced HTML options.

# Literature Review

Some articles have wonderful titles [e.g., @carmichael_laziness_1954, p. 295; @ross_racial_2020].
